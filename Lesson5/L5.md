# Introduction to Data Structures in C++

## ‚ú® What is a Data Structure?

**Definition:** A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

**Purpose:**

* Organize data logically.
* Optimize access time and space usage.
* Solve problems efficiently depending on the nature of operations required.

**STL in C++:** The Standard Template Library provides ready-to-use implementations of data structures. You specify the type in angle brackets `<>`:

```cpp
vector<int> v;      // dynamic array of integers
pair<string, int> p;  // pair of a string and an integer
```

Most STL structures support the following methods:

* `.size()` ‚Üí Returns the number of elements
* `.empty()` ‚Üí Checks if the structure is empty

**When to Use:**

Use the STL when:

* You want to avoid reinventing the wheel.
* You need efficient, well-tested data containers.
* You value cleaner syntax and flexibility over raw performance.

## üìÅ Arrays (Static Arrays)

**Definition:** A static array is a fixed-size container of elements of the same type.

**Declaration:**

```cpp
int arr[10];           // elements are uninitialized (garbage values)
int arr[10] = {0};     // initializes all elements to 0
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3}; // array of size 3
```

**STL Array:**

```cpp
#include <array>
array<int, 10> arr;
arr[0] = 5;
cout << arr.size();  // returns 10
```

**Initialization Techniques:**

* `std::fill(arr, arr + 10, 0);`
* `memset(arr, 0, sizeof arr);` (caution: only for 0 or -1)

**Important Notes:**

* Stack-allocated arrays have a limited size (typically 10^6).
* Cannot dynamically resize.

**When to Use:**

* When the size is known at compile time.
* For simple problems with small or fixed input sizes.
* When speed and memory locality are more important than flexibility.

## üîÄ Dynamic Arrays (Vectors)

**Definition:** Vectors are resizable arrays provided by the STL.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
#include <vector>
vector<int> v;
v.push_back(3);  // adds 3 to the end
```

**Initialization:**

```cpp
vector<int> v(5);        // 5 elements initialized to 0
vector<int> v(5, 7);     // 5 elements, each set to 7
```

**Resizing:**

```cpp
v.resize(10);            // change size to 10
```

**Multidimensional Vectors:**

```cpp
vector<vector<int>> matrix(3, vector<int>(4, 0)); // 3x4 matrix of 0s
```

**When to Use:**

* When size of data is not known in advance.
* When you require dynamic memory allocation.
* When you want to use STL methods like `.push_back()` or `.insert()`.

## üîÑ Iterating Through Data Structures

**For Loop (Index Based):**

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {
    cout << v[i];
}
```

**Iterator:**

```cpp
for (vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
    cout << *it;
}
```

**Range-Based For Loop:**

```cpp
for (int val : v) {
    cout << val;
}
```

**When to Use:**

* Index-based: when you need to know or modify the index.
* Iterators: when working with more generic containers.
* Range-based: for simple read-only traversal.

## ‚ûï Inserting and Erasing

**Insertion:**

```cpp
v.push_back(10);         // O(1)
```

**Update Value:**

```cpp
v[2] = 5;
```

**Erase Element:**

```cpp
v.erase(v.begin() + 1);  // O(n) operation
```

**When to Use:**

* Use `.push_back()` for appending values efficiently.
* Avoid frequent `.insert()` or `.erase()` in the middle of vectors.
* Consider other data structures (like deque or list) for heavy insert/erase workloads.

---

## üî¢ Strings

**Definition:** A string is a sequence of characters.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
string s = "hello";
```

**Common Methods:**

* `s.size()` or `s.length()`
* `s.substr(start, length)`
* `s += " world"` (concatenation)

**Looping Through a String:**

```cpp
for (char c : s) cout << c;
```

**When to Use:**

* Anytime you deal with textual data.
* Common in parsing, formatting, or generating output.

---

## üîã Pairs

**Definition:** A pair holds two values, possibly of different types.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
pair<int, string> p = {5, "apple"};
cout << p.first << " " << p.second;
```

**Usage:** Storing coordinates, key-value associations.

**Vector of Pairs:**

```cpp
vector<pair<int, int>> points;
points.push_back({1, 2});
```

**When to Use:**

* To return two values from a function.
* To store compound data such as coordinates or mappings.
* Inside sorting/comparison problems.

---

## üìÑ Tuples

**Definition:** Tuples can store multiple values of varying types.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
#include <tuple>
tuple<int, string, double> t = make_tuple(1, "hi", 3.14);
```

**Access and Modify:**

```cpp
cout << get<1>(t);
get<2>(t) = 2.71;
```

**Unpacking:**

```cpp
int a; string b; double c;
tie(a, b, c) = t;
```

**When to Use:**

* To return or pass more than 2 values.
* Avoid when the number of elements makes readability difficult.

---

## üß∞ Memory Considerations

* 1 `int` = 4 bytes
* Max usable memory in USACO = ~256 MB

**How many ints?**

```text
256 * 10^6 bytes / 4 = 64 million ints (approx)
```

**Tips:**

* Use vectors for large data.
* Avoid large arrays inside functions (prefer global).
* Be careful with recursion depth and memory limits.

---

## üßÆ Basic Complete Search

**Definition:** Complete Search (or brute-force search) is the process of exploring all possible configurations to find a solution.

**When to Use:**

* Small search spaces
* Checking all permutations, subsets, or combinations
* When you are unsure of an optimized method

**Common Patterns:**

1. **Loop through all values:**

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i <= 100; ++i) {
    if (valid(i)) cout << i << " is a solution";
}
```

2. **Nested Loops:** Useful for 2D/3D or pairwise checking.

```cpp
for (int a = 0; a <= 10; ++a) {
    for (int b = 0; b <= 10; ++b) {
        if (valid(a, b)) cout << a << " " << b;
    }
}
```

3. **Bitmasking for Subsets (Advanced):**

```cpp
int n = 4;
for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); ++mask) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (mask & (1 << i)) cout << "Include " << i;
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

**Caution:** Avoid in large search spaces due to time complexity.

**Tip:** Try pruning search space with `if` conditions when possible.
