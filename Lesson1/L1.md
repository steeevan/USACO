* **Format** :
* 4 online contests per year:  **December** ,  **January** ,  **February** , **March**
* Each contest has **3 problems** and lasts  **4 hours** .
* Scoring is based on passing test cases (up to 100 points per problem).
* **Website** :
* [https://usaco.org](https://usaco.org/)
* Register for free to participate in contests and view past problems.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why We Use C++ (Instead of Python)

C++ is the preferred language for competitive programming.

| Feature        | C++                            | Python                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Speed          | üöÄ Very fast (compiled)        | üê¢ Slower (interpreted)       |
| Libraries      | STL (priority_queue, set, map) | Less competitive-focus tools  |
| Input/Output   | `cin`,`cout`(very fast)    | `input()`,`print()`slower |
| Memory Control | High, with pointers            | Automatic (less precise)      |
| Time Limits    | Less likely to TLE             | TLE more common in USACO      |

We‚Äôll use C++ because it teaches good habits, is faster, and is the best fit for algorithmic contests like USACO.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ C++ Concepts Needed for Bronze Problems

These are the core concepts we‚Äôll focus on first:

* `#include <iostream>` ‚Äì standard input/output
* `#include <fstream>` ‚Äì file input/output for USACO problems
* `using namespace std;` ‚Äì saves typing `std::cout`
* `int main()` ‚Äì entry point for your C++ program
* Data types ‚Äì `int`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, `string`
* Operators ‚Äì `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
* Conditionals ‚Äì `if`, `else if`, `else`
* Loops ‚Äì `for`, `while`
* Functions ‚Äì reusable logic
* STL (Standard Template Library) ‚Äì `vector`, `set`, `map`, etc.
* File I/O for USACO:
  ```cpp
  freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
  freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
  ```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ First Example Program ‚Äì Adding Two Numbers

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << "The sum is: " << a + b << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

 **What it does** :

* Takes two numbers from user input.
* Prints their sum.

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Beginner Exercises (with Solutions)

### üü® Exercise 1: Rectangle Area

 **Task** : Ask the user for width and height and compute the area of a rectangle.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int width, height;
    cout << "Width: ";
    cin >> width;
    cout << "Height: ";
    cin >> height;
    int area = width * height;
    cout << "Area: " << area << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### üü® Exercise 2: Convert Minutes to Hours and Minutes

 **Task** : Ask user for total minutes and convert it into hours and leftover minutes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int totalMinutes;
    cout << "Enter total minutes: ";
    cin >> totalMinutes;
    int hours = totalMinutes / 60;
    int minutes = totalMinutes % 60;
    cout << "Hours: " << hours << endl;
    cout << "Minutes: " << minutes << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ USACO Problem ‚Äì Blocked Billboard

### üìù Problem Description

You are given two billboards and one truck, each defined as rectangles with bottom-left and top-right corners.
The truck might partially or completely cover either or both billboards. Find the total area of both billboards that remains visible.

### üî£ Input Format

3 lines of 4 integers:

* Line 1: billboard A (x1 y1 x2 y2)
* Line 2: billboard B (x1 y1 x2 y2)
* Line 3: truck     (x1 y1 x2 y2)

### üî¢ Output Format

* One integer: total visible area of both billboards

### üìò Sample Input

```
1 2 3 5
6 0 10 4
2 1 8 3
```

### üìê Sample Output

```
17
```

### üßÆ Key Definitions and Math Concepts

* **Rectangle area** : Width √ó Height = (x2 - x1) √ó (y2 - y1)
* **Overlap width** : min(x2, truck_x2) - max(x1, truck_x1)
* **Overlap height** : min(y2, truck_y2) - max(y1, truck_y1)
* **Visible Area** = Billboard Area - Overlap Area (if overlap exists)
* Use `max(0, overlap)` to avoid negative area when no overlap occurs

### ‚úÖ Solution Using Structs

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

struct Rect {
  int x1, y1, x2, y2;
};

int area(Rect r) {
  return (r.x2 - r.x1) * (r.y2 - r.y1);
}

int intersect_area(Rect p, Rect q) {
  int x_overlap = max(0, min(p.x2, q.x2) - max(p.x1, q.x1));
  int y_overlap = max(0, min(p.y2, q.y2) - max(p.y1, q.y1));
  return x_overlap * y_overlap;
}

int main() {
  ifstream fin("billboard.in");
  ofstream fout("billboard.out");

  Rect a, b, t; // Billboards and truck
  fin >> a.x1 >> a.y1 >> a.x2 >> a.y2;
  fin >> b.x1 >> b.y1 >> b.x2 >> b.y2;
  fin >> t.x1 >> t.y1 >> t.x2 >> t.y2;

  fout << area(a) + area(b) - intersect_area(a,t) - intersect_area(b,t) << "\n";
  return 0;
}
```

### üîç Code Breakdown

* **Struct `Rect`** : A reusable data structure for rectangles
* **Function `area`** : Returns width √ó height
* **Function `intersect_area`** :
* Finds overlapping width and height
* Uses `max(0, ‚Ä¶)` to prevent negative areas
* **Main Function** :
* Reads rectangles from file
* Computes total visible area = area(A) + area(B) - overlapping area with truck
