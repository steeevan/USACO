**USACO C++ Prep Course - Lesson 2**

---

## 👁‍🗨️ Overview

This lesson covers how computers store data using bits and bytes, explores C++ data types, and applies this knowledge to real USACO Bronze problems. By understanding the size and limitations of data types, students will improve their coding accuracy and performance in contests.

## 📄 Homework Assignment: Lesson 2 Review

### ✍️ Part 1: Definitions

Write your own definitions for the following C++ keywords and concepts:

1. Bit
2. Byte
3. Data Type
4. `int`
5. `double`
6. `bool`
7. Type casting
8. `sizeof()`
9. `cin`
10. `cout`

### 🔢 Part 2: Convert Byte to Decimal Value

Each of the following binary values is a **byte** (8 bits). Convert each one into its  **decimal value** .

1. `00001111` = _______
2. `10101010` = _______
3. `11110000` = _______
4. `00000001` = _______
5. `11111111` = _______

### 🧪 Part 3: Code Problems

#### Problem 1: Temperature Converter

Read a floating-point temperature in Celsius and convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula:

**F = C 	imes rac{9}{5} + 32**. Print the result with 2 digits after the decimal.

**Sample Input:**

```
25.0
```

**Sample Output:**

```
77.00
```

---

#### Problem 2: Safe Product of Large Numbers

Read two integers `a` and `b` (up to 10^9 each), and print their product. Use the correct data type to avoid overflow.

**Sample Input:**

```
1000000000 3
```

**Sample Output:**

```
3000000000
```

---

#### Problem 3: Is Digit?

Ask the user to enter a single character. Print `true` if it is a digit (`0`–`9`), otherwise print `false`.

**Sample Input:**

```
7
```

**Sample Output:**

```
true
```

Students should write code for all three problems and submit:

* Source code (.cpp files)
* A text or screenshot of program outputs
* Completed definitions and conversions
